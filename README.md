# Page Stack Scrolling

I was trying to do some *stack* type scrolling (both up and down) with multiple stack (pages) using just JavaScript and Transform element without any external library.

ðŸš€ I could say that the goal I was trying to achieve about transforming different elements based on different values is successfully achieved and of course an another interesting project on which I worked on.
